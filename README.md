# shoulda-matchers [![Gem Version][fury-badge]][fury] [![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis]

[Official Documentation][rubydocs]

shoulda-matchers provides Test::Unit- and RSpec-compatible one-liners that test
common Rails functionality. These tests would otherwise be much longer, more
complex, and error-prone.

### ActiveModel Matchers

## Installation

### RSpec

Include the gem in your Gemfile:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'shoulda-matchers'
end
```

### Test::Unit

shoulda-matchers was originally a component of
[Shoulda](http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda) -- it's what provides the nice
`should` syntax which is demonstrated below. For this reason, include it in
your Gemfile instead:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'shoulda'
end
```

### Non-Rails apps

Once it is loaded, shoulda-matchers automatically includes itself into your test
framework. It will mix in the appropriate matchers for ActiveRecord,
ActiveModel, and ActionController depending on the modules that are available at
runtime. For instance, in order to use the ActiveRecord matchers, ActiveRecord
must be available beforehand.

If your application is on Rails, everything should "just work", as
shoulda-matchers will most likely be declared after Rails in your Gemfile. If
your application is on another framework such as Sinatra or Padrino, you may
have a different setup, so you will want to ensure that you are requiring
shoulda-matchers after the components of Rails you are using. For instance,
if you wanted to use and test against ActiveModel, you'd say:

```ruby
gem 'activemodel'
gem 'shoulda-matchers'
```

and not:

```ruby
gem 'shoulda-matchers'
gem 'activemodel'
```

## Generating documentation

YARD is used to generate documentation, which can be viewed online at
<http://thoughtbot.github.com/shoulda-matchers>. You can preview changes you
make to the documentation locally by running

    yard doc

from this directory. Then, open `doc/index.html` in your browser.

If you want to see a live preview as you work without having to run `yard` over
and over again, keep this command running in a separate terminal session:

    watchr yard.watchr
